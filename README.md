# LeConteMultibeam_2016_2017
Multibeam data of LeConte Glacier face

These are processed multibeam sonar data from LeConte Glacier, southeast Alaska. The data come from two cruises: 1) August 2016 and 2) May 2017. 

Note these data are of the ice face itself, exlcuding any seafloor data. They are in WGS84 vertical and UTM zone 8 horizontal (meters in easting/northing). There are several different passes of the ice face included for each year, which you can identify by the assigned time stamp.
